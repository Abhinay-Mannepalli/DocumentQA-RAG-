# DocumentQA-RAG-
## Introduction
DocumentQA is an application that allows users to get an answer on a specific question customized on a specific set of articles.The application was built using Retrieval Augmented Generation approach. Streamlit package is used to make a quick interactive data app.
## Tech stack
- Vector Database: Pinecone
- Embedding model: 'text-embedding-ada-002'
- LLM: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Language Used- Python

## Implementation
- Install all the requirements in requirement.txt.
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  ```
- Create a OPENAI API User secret key in platform.openai.com
- Create a Pinecone index in pinecone.io
    - Cloud provider: AWS
    - Dimensions:1536(vector size of embeddings generated by the embedding model)
- Create a '.env' file and include the following keys
    - OPENAI_KEY
    - PINECONE_KEY
    - PINECONE_INDEX
- Run all the cells in vectorDB.ipynb to create a Vector database.
    - Reads the data from documents using PYPDF.
    - splits the data into chunks(Customize your chunk size).
    - Generates the embeddings of each chunk using embedding model.
    - Uploads the embeddings to the Vector database.
- Run the following command to start the documentQA application.
  ```sh
  streamlit run documentQA.py
  
  ```
